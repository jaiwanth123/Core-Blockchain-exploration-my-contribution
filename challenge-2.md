## STRUCTURE OF COREDAO CHAIN:

ARCHITECTURE:
   
Core chain is the first  Bitcoin-aligned EVM-compatiblite chain .Coredao is a LAYER-1 chain. It is a decentralized, secure, and scalable blockchain network backed by Bitcoin’s PoW. Core Chain is designed to unlock Bitcoin’s protection by enabling Bitcoin miners to delegate their security to an EVM-compatible smart contract platform and allowing holders of BTC to stake on Core Chain without giving up custody. 

components of Core Chain, which is designed to function as a highly scalable smart contract platform that enhances Bitcoin’s utility without compromising its foundational principles.
                                
HOW BLOCKS ARE CONNECTED:

Blocks in the CoreDAO blockchain are connected to one another using cryptographic hashes. This method ensures that each block is securely linked to the previous one, maintaining the integrity and immutability of the blockchain .

The cryptographic hash of each block acts as a unique identifier, which is generated through a complex mathematical process. This hash serves as a digital fingerprint for the block, ensuring that any alteration in the block's data would result in a completely different hash, thereby protecting the blockchain from tampering.

WHAT DOES EACH BLOCK CONTAINS:

    No official information given by them.

WHAT IS THE LOWEST UNIT OF CORE CHAIN:

    No official information given by them.


## CONSENSUS OF CORE DAO:

 CoreDao uses a unique consensus mechanism called  The Satoshi Plus consensus mechanism.This  consensus model merges Delegated Proof of Work (DPoW), Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), and Non-custodial Bitcoin Staking.So this allows bitcoin miners to participate directly in the governance and security of a decentralized smart contract platform without any additional costs

 WHAT IS DELEGATED PROOF OF WORK:
 
 Delegated Proof of Work (DPoW) is a consensus mechanism  which combines elements of both Proof of Work (PoW) and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS). In DPoW, a main blockchain, often using a PoW system, provides security for a secondary blockchain. The secondary blockchain selects a group of trusted nodes, known as delegates, to perform the work of creating new blocks and validating transactions. These delegates are usually elected by the network participants

 WHAT IS DELEGATED PROOF OF STAKE:

 Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) is a consensus algorithm used in blockchain networks that  uses a voting system where stakeholders vote for a small number of delegates to validate transactions and maintain the blockchain. These delegates, also known as witnesses or block producers, are responsible for creating and verifying new blocks, with their performance subject to the approval of the voting stakeholders. If delegates fail to perform their duties effectively, they can be voted out and replaced.

 ## REWARDING MECHANISM IN COREDAO:

 Rewards Distribution: Both miners and stakers receive rewards in CORE tokens, aligning their interests with the network's health. 

Workflow: Rewards are calculated based on several factors including the amount of computational power or tokens contributed, and are distributed automatically by the Core Chain protocol. This incentivizes continuous and honest participation in the network.

## VULNARABILITIES AND ATTACKS ON COREDAO:

CoreDAO Chain has undergone several security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities:

Security Issues Addressed: Halborn's audit identified several security issues in CoreDAO's contracts, which were successfully addressed by the CoreDAO team. These included issues like missing initialization functions and unsafe ERC20 operations 

Specific Vulnerabilities: The audit highlighted specific vulnerabilities such as incompatibility with multi-signature wallets and  variables in contracts, all of which were resolved

While CoreDAO Chain has faced and addressed several security vulnerabilities, there has been no reported successful 51% attacks or double-spend attacks on the network officialy.

## IS THE CORE CHAIN SUSPECTIBLE FOR CHAIN REORGS:

No official information given.

## AVG BLOCK INTERVAL AND CONFIMATION TIME:

The average transaction confirmation time on the Core network is 12 blocks.But no official avg block interval is mentioned.

## GAS FEES OR TRANSACTION COST:

Yes like all other blockchains Core dao has also have gas fees for all the transactions or changes  take place in blockchain.But the exact amount gas fee is not clear yet.

Core token is used for all transaction fees (gas costs).


## STANDARDS FOR FUNGIBLE,SEMI-FUNGIBLE AND NON FUNGIBLE TOKENS:

ERC721 is a standard for non-fungible tokens in Coredao

ERC20 is the standard for fungible tokens in CoreDao

No details regarding standards of semi-fungible tokens in CoreDao
    
## Some popular non-fungible tokens:

Yes there are some popular non -fungible tokens which are available in core dao ,below are the tokens and thier addresses in core mainnet:

## PREVENTION FROM ATTACKS :

No official information about how core dao prevents from replay and withholding attacks but there are some prevention measures from other attacks.
